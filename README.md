# InvertedPendulum with Communication Networks


The aim of the simulation is to design a Networked Control System for controlling the arm of a
disk drive, by carefully designing the controller, choosing the sampling rate and the frame rate (if
possible). The system in this project consists of an inverted pendulum mounted to a motorized
cart. This system is unstable without control, that is, the pendulum will simply fall over if the
cart isn't moved to balance it. It is very common in classical control textbooks, but they do not
consider the communication effects.

Investigation of the performance of the system is done by designing a controller for different types of networks as modeled in TrueTime
(http://www.control.lth.se/truetime/) simulator.
